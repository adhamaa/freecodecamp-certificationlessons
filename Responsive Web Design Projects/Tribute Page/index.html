        <h2>Here's a time line of Ibn Sina :</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            980 - Avicenna was born in Afshana, a village near Bukhara (in
            present-day Uzbekistan), the capital of the Samanids, a Persian
            dynasty in Central Asia and Greater Khorasan.
          </li>
          <li>
            997 - He turned to medicine at 16, and not only learned medical
            theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had, according
            to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment.
          </li>
          <li>999 - Achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18</li>
          <li>1004 - At 22 years old, Avicenna lost his father.</li>
          <li>
            1012 - Avicenna himself was at this time stricken by a severe
            illness.
          </li>
          <li>
            1024 - Ibn Sina was hiding from the war of Isfahan and Hamadãn
          </li>
          <li>
            1025/1035 - The remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn Sīnā's life
            were spent in the service of the Kakuyid ruler Muhammad ibn Rustam
            Dushmanziyar (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as
            physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his
            numerous campaigns.
          </li>
          <li>
            1037 - He died, in his fifty-eighth year, in the month of Ramadan
            and was buried in Hamadan, Iran
          </li>
          "از قعر گل سیاه تا اوج زحل کردم همه مشکلات گیتی را حل بیرون جستم زقید
          هر مکر و حیل هر بند گشاده شد مگر بند اجل"
          <br />
          "From the depth of the black earth up to Saturn's apogee, All the
          problems of the universe have been solved by me. I have escaped from
          the coils of snares and deceits; I have unraveled all knots except the
          knot of Death."
        </ul>
