        <h2 id="headline" class="headtext">Here's a time line of Ibn Sina :</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>980</strong> - Avicenna was born in Afshana, a village near
            Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan), the capital of the Samanids, a
            Persian dynasty in Central Asia and Greater Khorasan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>997</strong> - He turned to medicine at 16, and not only
            learned medical theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the
            sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of
            treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>999</strong> - Achieved full status as a qualified physician
            at age 18
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1004</strong> - At 22 years old, Avicenna lost his father.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1012</strong> - Avicenna himself was at this time stricken
            by a severe illness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1024</strong> - Ibn Sina was hiding from the war of Isfahan
            and Hamadãn
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1025-1035</strong> - The remaining ten or twelve years of
            Ibn Sīnā's life were spent in the service of the Kakuyid ruler
            Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom
            he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific
            adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1037</strong> - He died, in his fifty-eighth year, in the
            month of Ramadan and was buried in Hamadan, Iran
          </li>
